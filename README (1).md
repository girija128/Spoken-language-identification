# Spoken-language-identification
ABSTRACT

Identifying the spoken language in the form of an audio clip by a speaker using a model is called Spoken language identification. Here the tedious task is to recognize the important features that differentiate languages. The proposed system collects numerous audio files and converts them to spectrogram

images for which convolutional neural network algorithms are applied to it to detect the language.

The main objective of the proposed system is to detect the languages spoken by the speaker for 3 to

4 languages with the gender identification of the speaker. Experiments will be conducted on different

audio files using the Kaggle dataset named spoken language identification. These audio files are comprised of utterances, each of them spanning over a fixed duration of 10 seconds. The whole dataset is

split into training and test sets. The proposed system identifies the gender of the speaker and translate

of the identified language into English.
